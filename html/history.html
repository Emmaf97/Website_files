                <h1>1985–1988: Birth of the Hornets</h1>
                <p>In 1985, the NBA was planning to expand by three teams by the 1988–89 season, later modified to
                    include a total of four expansion teams.
                    George Shinn, an entrepreneur from Kannapolis, wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area,
                    and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise.
                    The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for college basketball. Charlotte was also one of the
                    fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional
                    homes to the American Basketball Association's (ABA) Carolina Cougars from 1969 to 1974.
                    Despite doubt from critics, Shinn's ace in the hole was the Charlotte Coliseum, a state-of-the-art
                    arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators, the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve
                    as a full-time home for an NBA team.
                    On April 5, 1987, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern called Shinn to tell him his group had been
                    awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in 1988.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Franchises were also granted to Miami, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and Orlando.
                Originally, the new team was going to be called the Charlotte Spirit, but a name-the-team contest
                yielded "Hornets" as the winning choice.
                The name originates from British General Cornwallis, who allegedly described the city as "a hornet's
                nest of rebellion" following the Battle of Charlotte in 1780, though it was first attested in 1819.
                The team received further attention when it chose teal as its primary color, setting off a sports
                fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
                The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian,
                featured a first for NBA uniforms—pin stripes.
                Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.</p>
            <p>Shinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager.
                Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as
                possible.
                Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant Dick Harter was hired as the team's first head coach.
                In 1988, the Hornets and the Miami Heat were part of the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft.
                Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young
                players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive
                lineup on the court right away.
                The team also had three draft picks at the 1988 NBA draft.</p>

                <h1>1988–1992: Early seasons</h1>
                <p>The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the Charlotte Coliseum, losing 133–93
                    to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
                    Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, 117–105.
                    On December 23, 1988, the Hornets beat Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 103–101 in Jordan's
                    first return to North Carolina as a professional.
                    The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20–62.
                    Scheer left prior to the 1989–90 season.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Despite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA
                in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte.
                Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.
                The Hornets' second season was a struggle from start to finish.
                Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced
                mid-season by assistant Gene Littles following an 8–32 start.
                Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19–63
                record.</p>
            <p>The team showed improvement during the following season.
                They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120–105 victory over the Washington Bullets.
                However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games.
                The Hornets, who hosted the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, finished with a 26–56 record.
                Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of
                the season and replaced by general manager Allan Bristow.
            </p>
            <p>With the first pick in the 1991 NBA draft, the Hornets drafted power forward Larry Johnson from the
                University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
                Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the
                1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award.
                Additionally, Guard Kendall Gill led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game.
                The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31–51 record.

                <h1>2004–2014: Charlotte Bobcats</h1>
                <p>Shortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, as well as to avoid a Browns-like lawsuit,
                    the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the 2004–05
                    season, provided that an arena deal could be reached.
                    Several ownership groups, including one led by former Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, made bids for
                    the franchise.
                    On December 18, 2002, a group led by BET founder Robert L. Johnson was awarded the franchise,
                    allowing him to become the first African American majority owner in U.S. major professional sports
                    since the Negro leagues.
                    The franchise with Johnson as its owner was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on January 10,
                    2003.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Hip-hop artist Nelly became a notable co-owner.
                The owners paid a $300 million expansion fee to enter the league.
                In June 2003, the team name was officially announced as the Bobcats.
                The Charlotte Regional Sports Commission aided the naming process with a "Help Name The Team" effort
                that drew over 1,250 suggestions, with 'Flight' being the winner.
                However, it was discarded by Johnson and the team involved in creating the team's identity, being
                considered abstract and reminiscent of the then-current Iraq War aerial strikes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given Charlotte was already home to a cat-named team, the Carolina Panthers of the National Football
                League, designer Chris Weiller made sure to create a logo that would not be similar to the Panthers
                logo.
                It has also been speculated that Johnson chose the name "Bobcats" in reference to his own name.
                The Bobcats hired Bernie Bickerstaff as the first head coach and general manager in franchise history.
                A new arena to host the Bobcats in uptown Charlotte began construction in July 2003.
                The team would play its home games at the Coliseum until the new building was ready.</p>

                <h1>2014–present: Return of the Hornets</h1>
                <p>On May 21, 2013, Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to
                    change the name of the franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season, pending a
                    majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas on July 18, 2013.
                    The NBA announced, on July 18, 2013, that it had unanimously approved the rebranding, which would
                    begin upon the conclusion of the 2013–14 season.
                    The Bobcats announced on November 22, they would adopt a modified version of the original Hornets'
                    teal-purple-white color palette, with black, gray and Carolina blue as accents.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The team officially unveiled its future logo and identity scheme during halftime of their December 21
                game against the Jazz.
                The team also started the "Buzz City" campaign to hype up the Hornets return.
                On January 16, 2014, the Bobcats revealed new Hornets shirts, hats and gear.</p>
            <p> On May 20, 2014, the Bobcats officially became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets.
                At a press conference regarding the change, team officials also announced that as part of a deal with
                the NBA and the renamed New Orleans Pelicans, Charlotte acquired the history and records of the
                1988–2002 Hornets (in a move similar to that of the National Football League's Cleveland Browns return
                to the league in 1999), while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to
                2013 remained with the Pelicans.
                The Hornets are now retconned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are
                considered a 2002 expansion team. Charlotte had already been using past footage of the original Hornets
                as part of the "Buzz City" campaign.
