I do not own any of the icon images used in this site all rights go to the NBA. They are used as part of project work to demonstrate my college course portfolio.
I do not own any text used in this project, it was sourced from wikipedia.

Here is the link to view the current site.

The link will be removed in time to demonstrate my next portfolio piece.
